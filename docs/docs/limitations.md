# Limitations

Frent has a number (ha) of numerical limitations that you hopefully never reach. If you do, please tell me.

* 2,147,483,647 Entities per world
* 65,535 Worlds at a time
* 65,535 Unique component types
* 65,535 Unique archetypes
* 127 Components per entity

Things that do not have limits (within reason) are:
* Number of `Update` methods on a component
* Number of filter attributes on a component method
